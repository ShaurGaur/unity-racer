# Unity Racer
My first Unity 3D game - a simple platform "racing" style game.
Based on [Jonas Tyroller's excellent Unity 3D tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCBqgREiSUE).

## About
You are a ball, and your objective is to make it to the end of the level without falling off of the map and into the lava.

## Controls
`WASD`: move up, left, down, right respectively.

`R`: restart. 
- The game automatically restarts if you fall off of the floor.

`Esc`: end. 
- The game automatically ends once you hit the back wall on the ending box.

## Execution
Download the `build` folder and run "MyFirstGame" from within it. Enjoy!
